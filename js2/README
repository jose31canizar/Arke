Simple WebGL Scene. I struggled with this assignment so I was only able to get ambient light to work. I'm not sure
why my Phong function fails to light up the scene. Also had problems with gl.DrawArrays indexing out of range and the normals.
The scene just changes color with the buttons. 
I planned on putting more icosahedron shapes but was spending too much time on figuring out what was wrong with my phong lighting.

How to Run:
open html file.

Time to Complete:
8 hours
